# DevFindr Mockups!

Hi! These mockups were developed by Jacob Tonna from LambdaSchool's Web 19 class.
Inside you'll find 2 folders **Exports** & **Sketches & Mockups**.
If you have questions feel free to reach out to me, id love to help future iterations and teams.

Adobe XD Has a share feature (top right) that allows you to share for Review or Development. You can generate these yourself with your cloud version of the document.

**_Note: The Review  & Development link might not work in future iterations as adobe xd only allows free accounts to have 1 project at a time with links to review & development_**
with that being said there is a local copy of the entire project in the Sketched & Mockups folder.

The live production version of this project is avaliable here -> https://devfindr.com

## Exports

The **Exports** folder is used by the Developers on the team to gain quick access to rendered artboards and assets used in the design mockups.

## Sketched & Mockups

Nearly every page started as a Low Fidelity Sketch, the tool i used was autodesk sketchbook. After a sketch was complete i developed it in Adobe XD and exported the artboard into the Exports Folder. Its pretty simple, cut and dry. Some pages are medium - low fidelity as there might not have been enough time to make a high fidelity version since im not only the ux/ui for the ream but also a web dev for the team.
